                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>Bootstrp is a CSS framework. Let's define it this way: would you like to go to the bush and get logs of wood inorder to make a 
                    table or you would prefer to have all the logs already cut in their right proportion. This is what Bootstrap does: it gives you in-build libraries so you don't have to do things from scratch
